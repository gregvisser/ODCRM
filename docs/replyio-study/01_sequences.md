- **Create a folder**: Button to organize sequences
- **Install extension**: Browser extension prompt
- **Search box**: Text search for sequences
- **Checkbox**: Select all/none toggle
- **Individual sequence actions**: Three-dot menu button per sequence

### Organization Features

- **Owner filtering**: "My" filter for personal sequences
- **Status filtering**: Dropdown to filter by sequence status
- **Search**: Text search capability
- **Grid layout**: Table format with sortable columns

### Sequence Actions Discovered
- **Toggle switch**: Each sequence has an on/off toggle (likely for active/inactive status)
- **Checkbox**: For bulk selection of sequences
- **Three-dot menu**: Individual sequence actions menu
- **Cancel/Save buttons**: Suggests edit/create mode is accessible

### Sequence Creation Flow
**DISCOVERED:** When "New sequence" button is clicked, a form appears with "Cancel" and "Save" buttons visible.

**Form Fields Identified (from visible text):**
- **Name**: Sequence name field
- **Domain name**: Primary domain field
- **Account name**: Account identifier field
- **Domain secondary**: Secondary domain field
- **Description**: Sequence description field
- **Email**: Email field (likely sender email)
- **Phone**: Phone number field
- **Industry**: Industry selection field
- **Company size**: Company size selection field
- **LinkedIn profile**: LinkedIn URL field
- **Twitter profile**: Twitter URL field
- **Country**: Country selection field
- **State**: State/region field
- **City**: City field
- **Time Zone**: Timezone selection field

**Form Structure:**
- **22 input fields total**: Mix of text inputs, selects, and other form elements
- **1 form element**: Single form container
- **Action buttons**: Cancel, Save (suggests draft/save workflow)
- **No dialogs**: Form appears inline on the sequences page

### Sequence Editor View
**DISCOVERED:** Sequence creation form is focused on metadata, step creation appears to be separate workflow.

**Step-Level Fields (Not Yet Observed):**
- Step creation appears to happen after initial sequence metadata is set
- No visible step builder elements in the current form
- Likely accessed through a separate "Edit Steps" or similar interface

**Assumption:** Step creation is a multi-stage process:
1. Create sequence with basic metadata (name, domains, description)
2. Then add/configure individual steps (emails, delays, conditions)

**Step Conditions:**
- What conditions can be set? ("If no reply", "If opened", etc.)
- How are conditions configured?
- Multiple conditions per step?

### Enrollment & Targeting
**Document:**
- How contacts are added to sequences?
- List/segment selection options?
- Bulk enrollment features?
- Rules like "stop on reply", "stop on bounce", "stop on unsubscribe"?
- Enrollment triggers (immediate, scheduled, conditional)?

### Sequence Status & Lifecycle
**Observe:**
- What status options exist? (Draft, Active, Paused, Stopped, etc.)
- How to change sequence status?
- Any automated status changes?
- Sequence completion criteria?

### Advanced Features
**Look for:**
- A/B testing capabilities?
- Sending windows/time zones?
- Throttling/limiting options?
- Priority settings?
- Performance-based optimization?

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Data Structure**: What entities and relationships can you infer?
2. **Workflow**: What is the typical sequence creation → enrollment → execution flow?
3. **Automation**: What happens automatically vs requires manual intervention?
4. **Limits**: Any visible constraints or limits mentioned?
5. **Integration**: Any visible integrations with other sections (People, Reports, etc.)?
