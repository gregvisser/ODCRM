## Next: Test Outlook OAuth

Now let's test the email functionality:

1. Stay on https://odcrm.vercel.app
2. Go to **Marketing** → **Email Accounts** tab
3. Click **"Connect Your First Outlook Account"**
4. Should redirect to Microsoft (if latest Vercel deployment is live)

## If OAuth Still Shows Localhost Error

Check Vercel deployments:
- Latest should be commit `0bba4c8` or newer
- Status should be "Ready"

If not, wait for deployment to complete, then try OAuth again.

## Remaining Tasks

- ⏳ Test Outlook OAuth
- ⏳ Verify background workers (Render logs)
- ⏳ Optional: Custom domains (GoDaddy DNS)

---

**Your system is 90% complete!** Data is restored. Just need to verify OAuth works!
