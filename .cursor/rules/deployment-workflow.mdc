# Deployment Workflow

After making any code changes, always follow this deployment workflow:

## 1. Commit Changes
- Stage relevant files with `git add`
- Create descriptive commit messages explaining what changed and why
- Use `git commit -m "message"` or interactive commit for detailed changes

## 2. Run Tests
- Run the appropriate test or lint command for the change
- Fix any failures before pushing

## 3. Push to Remote
- Push committed changes to the remote repository with `git push`
- Ensure you're on the correct branch before pushing
- Verify the push was successful

## 4. Deploy Changes
- Deploy to staging/production environment as appropriate
- Verify deployment completed successfully
- Test the deployed changes in the target environment

## When to Deploy
- After completing a feature or bug fix
- After significant refactoring
- After adding new functionality
- When changes are ready for testing or production

## Important Notes
- Never deploy uncommitted changes
- Run tests locally before pushing
- Use meaningful commit messages that explain the changes
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines pass before deploying
