- **Type exactly:** `App registrations`
- Press Enter or click the search result

### Step 3: You Should See

- A blue button that says **"+ New registration"** (usually top left)
- A list/grid of existing app registrations (may be empty if first time)

2. Click on **Microsoft Entra ID** (may show as tile or in results)

```

## 🔍 Visual Indicators

## ❓ Common Issues

### "I don't see the search bar"

- Or try: `aad`
- Make sure you have an active Azure subscription

- Look in the **left sidebar menu**
- Scroll down - it's usually in the middle of the menu
- Should be under "Manage" section

### "I get an error about permissions"
- Make sure you're using an account with Azure access
