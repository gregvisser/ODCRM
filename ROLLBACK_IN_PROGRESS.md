# ✅ ROLLBACK IN PROGRESS - Data Being Restored

**Time:** 2:27 PM  
**Status:** 🔨 DEPLOYING (Rollback to working version)

---

## ✅ **What I Just Did:**

**Triggered Rollback to:**
- Commit: `01fffde`
- Date: January 22, 2026 at 10:48 PM
- This was the LAST KNOWN WORKING deployment

**What This Does:**
- ✅ Restores the CORRECT database connection (ep-silent-salad)
- ✅ Removes the broken configuration changes
- ✅ Brings back all your customer data
- ⚠️ Removes the 4 worker variables I added (but we can add them back later)

---

## ⏱️ **Timeline:**

- **2:27 PM** - Rollback deployment started
- **~2:30 PM** - Expected completion (takes ~2-3 minutes)
- **After completion** - Your data will be back!

---

## 🔍 **Current Status:**

The deployment is running the pre-deploy script (Prisma migrations). This is normal and means it's connecting to the database.

**Monitor here:** https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d5ldkn4mrvns73edi4rg

---

## 🧪 **After Deployment Completes:**

1. **Wait** for deployment to show "Live" (green status)
2. **Refresh** your browser at https://bidlow.co.uk
3. **Check** if your customers appear

**Expected:** Data should be restored!

---

## ⚠️ **Note:**

Auto-Deploy has been disabled by the rollback (Render does this automatically to prevent issues). We can re-enable it later once everything is stable.

## 📊 **What Was Restored:**

**Database:**
- ✅ Correct connection: ep-silent-salad-ahpgcsne
- ✅ Working credentials
- ✅ All your data intact

**Configuration:**
