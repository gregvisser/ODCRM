VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
========================================

Add this in Vercel during project setup:

Key:
VITE_API_URL

Value:
https://odcrm-api.onrender.com

Environment:
☑ Production
☑ Preview (optional)
☐ Development (not needed)

========================================

IMPORTANT:
- This tells the frontend where to find the backend API
- Without this, the frontend will use localhost (won't work in production)
- You can update this later if needed (Settings → Environment Variables)

AFTER CUSTOM DOMAIN SETUP:
Update the value to:
https://api.yourdomain.com
