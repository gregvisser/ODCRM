## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### Backend Build Errors
- Some Prisma model name mismatches in code
- **Impact**: None on deployed version (already running)
- **Fix**: Can be addressed later if needed
- **Your system works because**: The deployed backend (commit 777388b) was built successfully earlier

### Email Account Not Showing in UI
- This may be a frontend refresh issue
- **Fix**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- The account IS in the database (OAuth success page confirmed it)
